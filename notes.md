'''
if an analysist publishes a research report and downgaddes the stock and cuts 
tha revenue expectation, the stock will go down
especially on a brand new company where the stock has done well, the market

the market bid the stock up because they expected it to do well.
negative report = the stock was bid too high and isn't actually worth that much

Benjamin Graham - the market is like a voting machine--tallying up which firms are popular and unpopular. But in the long run, the market is like a weighing machine--assessing the substance of a company.
battle between analysts and the stock
four outcomes:
more common:
stock up estimates up
stock down estimates down
more rare:
stock up estimates down
stock down estimates up

# Instead of doing fundamental analysis, did some qualatiative analysis as well
# peer group analysis. Which stocks have been as correlated?

# scatterplot
# the stock is the dependent variable, the Y axis
# change in earnings is the x axis, y axis is the stock
# stock market on the x, y axis is the stock (datadog)

# First make a regular stock chart
# Show sp 500, xlk, and ddog on one stock. index on $100 of all time, and ytd

# show sales and earnings for all time
# SEC xml data

# idea 1:
# price chart with multiple stocks
# make sure each stock on the same day (ddog is earliest i think?)
# 100/first day stock price. Multiply that factor by every other price for that stock. that factor is a constant.
# perserves all % changes
# time series


# market moves before the analysts
# if you reall wanna predit datadog, you have to predict this years earnings and
# next years earnings better than everyone else.
# because the stock won't change if it doesn't beat expectations.

# revenue estimate and price. make another oclumn thats day over day change in the revnenue estimate. and new col day over day change in price. those new cols are my x-y cols. or log both data series and graph that
# plot revenue on x and sp on y
# percent surprise vs percent stock price
