hi i was looking for a credit increase in your faq it said it s under settings when im logged in online but i don t see that option anywhere ty probably my mom doesn t have the card or account so i don t need to give her number hi i received us postal mail from you and want to be removed from your marketing lists can you help  the physical letter says on the frorit get the credit one bank platinum visa and is addressed to ursula m dalken 300 thank you  so today is the day please write me today i m going to need you to respond today today  i am having an issue with my account i can tell you that there was a fraudulent charge and credit one investigated the fraudulent charge made in june and considered it absolutely fraudulent and now wants to charge me for july and august bill even though the online website wouldn t let me access my account i don t know that the charge was taken off because i cannot see that it has been quite inconvenient because i don t even have online access to my account i m not sure why and i called and was put on hold several times and then was asked for a payment i m not making a payment until my new card arrives and that i have proof of the actual amount of my payments and that it does not include a late fee because i shouldn t be charged two months of late fees if i had no access to make a payment in two months is way too long to investigate a fraudulent charge i would like to be credited my late fees i m in i would also like to be credited for the inconvenience of my bills that are paid with this account i have had l te fees and extra fees with other bills they could not access my credit account i don t think i should have to pay any bill if i had no access to use the card or to pay on the card and if you would like a july and august payment i should not have to do that until i see something in writing that the fraudulent charge was taken off either on the website or through the mail my credit score should not of been impacted by a fraudulent investigation especially when the fraudulent investigation proves that the charge was fraudulent i m very angry about this it is absolutely inconvenienced me for two months now if you cannot credit my account the amount of july and august bill the late fees should be taken off and possibly i should be given credit in the form of an increase in my credit limit without charge i have been a valued customer since 2017 and very very very rarely do i miss a payment on time but i do see my credit score has been impacted because i was not able to pay july and august and i would have if my acess online to this account was not suspended so to be penalized is wrong and no i do not want to call the one 800 number because there is an accident or language barrier all they keep saying is let me process your payment how would you like to pay i m not paying anything until i see in writing the charge was lifted that was fraudulent and that i m not paying a late fee for something i had no access to  why is there not a customer service email  creditonebank i agree i had a fraudulent charge on my creditone card and they took my access away and now they want late fees for the two months it took them to consider the charge fraudulent anyway i can get a number to call an american credit one supervisor for new accounts as bob james kevin from india are of absolutely no help   creditonebank please respond to my dm creditonebank guys i have a question for you you should write me back or i m closing the account  100   creditonebank i will close it today  hi eduardo it is
