# Columbia ML
The source code for some machine learning projects I worked on at the Columbia Summer Immersion program.

## Projects
This repo includes source code that uses random forests, k-means, multiple regression, neural networks, and other algorithms. The final project
calculates the probability of a loan defaulting given certain financial data. It uses a variety of algorithms to reach the final prediction.
